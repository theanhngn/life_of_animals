Life of Animals

In this project, me (Anh Nguyen), Ai Hsiao, Tung Giang, and Aayush Joshipura are trying to stimulate artificial life in an ecosystem with rabbits, foxes, and grass. We create animated visualizations to display how the life happened before each generation. To make it more convenient for our users, we also incorporate command-line options that allow users to interact with the model and customize the amount according to their preferences.
